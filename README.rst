What is this?
=============

A custom keyboard layout for X11 (Linux).

Basically, it:

* Changes CapsLock to a level 3 shift. (Works like Shift, but instead of
  capital letters, you get… something else.)
* Makes Level3+Space into ``_`` and Shift+Level3+Space into ``-``. (_ and - are
  often used as word separators, like space is.)
* Moves the matching characters ``[{()}]`` onto the home row on the third
  level.
* Adds Level3+Backspace → Escape
